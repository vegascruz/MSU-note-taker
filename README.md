  ## Installation
  Go to my Github link which will be provided, download the code, make changes if you'd like or just push it to your heroku website. I will save my app link however, below.

  ## Usage
  Open the link, click the button "Get Started", and start taking some notes. After you've enter in your title and text, click the save icon in the right corner. It will then be added to the list on the left. The 'delete' button doesn't work... but I will add that later.

  ## Motivation
  This was a class assignment that turned out to be very very hard, but definetly worth it. I could always use a note taker to orgranize my life a bit haha. 

  ## Why?
  Coding bootcamp project

  ## Problem Solved?
  Allows for you to organize your day to day activities

  ## Things Learned
  I learned so much more! Express.js is starting to become more understandable, Heroku was a really awesome platform to deploy my project... relatively cheap too I think. I'm also starting to understand JSON files more and more. The toughest part of this project was working with routes and connecting the paths. It's a tough concept for me.
